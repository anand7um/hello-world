Change#2: I have made a fair bit of progress on this project and now hoping to merge two branches together using a pull request. Change#1 is my first branch with some changes in it. Change#2 is the second branch with yet more changes added to the master directly.

A pull request was created on Change#1 branch. Then Change#2 branch was created. Next, I will try to merge Change#1 and Change#2 into one of these branches before finally merging it back to the master.
